# Progress

## What Works
1. Project Structure
   - Directory structure created
   - Git repository initialized
   - .gitignore configured
   - Memory bank setup initiated

2. Documentation
   - Project brief created
   - Product context documented
   - Active context established
   - System patterns defined
   - Tech context documented
   - Progress tracking initiated

## What's Left to Build
1. Development Environment
   - [ ] Set up linting
   - [ ] Configure testing framework
   - [ ] Establish build process
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

2. Documentation
   - [ ] Complete README.md
   - [ ] Set up .cursor/rules
   - [ ] Create contribution guidelines
   - [ ] Document API specifications

3. Workflow
   - [ ] Establish branch protection rules
   - [ ] Set up automated testing
   - [ ] Configure deployment pipeline
   - [ ] Implement monitoring

## Current Status
### Completed
- Initial project setup

   - Need to establish monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Immediate
   - Complete README.md
   - Set up .cursor/rules
   - Establish linting configuration

2. Short-term
   - Set up testing framework
   - Configure build process
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline

3. Long-term
   - Implement monitoring
   - Set up deployment
   - Establish maintenance schedule
