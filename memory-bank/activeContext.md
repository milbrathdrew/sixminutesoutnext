# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Project planning and setup
- Next.js project initialization
- Component architecture design
- SEO strategy implementation

## Recent Changes
- Created project documentation
- Defined technical requirements
- Established architecture patterns
- Outlined component structure

## Next Steps
1. Project Setup
   - Initialize Next.js project
   - Configure TypeScript
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Configure static export

2. Component Development
   - Create layout components
   - Develop UI components
   - Implement content components
   - Set up responsive design

3. SEO Implementation
   - Configure meta tags
   - Implement semantic HTML
   - Generate sitemap
   - Set up structured data

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. Component Architecture
   - Atomic design methodology
   - Separation of concerns
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Responsive design patterns

2. Performance Optimization
   - Image optimization strategy
   - Font loading approach
   - Code splitting strategy
   - Core Web Vitals optimization

3. SEO Strategy
   - Meta tag structure
   - Semantic HTML implementation
   - Sitemap generation
   - Structured data approach

## Current Blockers
- Awaiting client content
- Need to confirm design direction
- Need to establish DNS configuration details

## Risks and Mitigations
1. Performance
   - Risk: Slow loading times
   - Mitigation: Implement Next.js optimization features, use next/image, optimize fonts

2. SEO
   - Risk: Poor search engine visibility
   - Mitigation: Implement proper semantic HTML, meta tags, and structured data

3. Email Deliverability
   - Risk: Poor email deliverability
   - Mitigation: Implement clean HTML, proper DNS configuration, technical separation
