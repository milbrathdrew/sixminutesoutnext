# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial project setup
- Documentation system establishment
- Development workflow implementation

## Recent Changes
- Created project directory structure
- Initialized git repository
- Set up .gitignore
- Created initial memory bank files

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank setup
   - Create remaining documentation files
   - Set up .cursor/rules
   - Create README.md

2. Establish development workflow
   - Set up branch structure
   - Define commit message format
   - Establish review process

3. Configure development environment
   - Set up linting
   - Configure testing framework
   - Establish build process

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. Documentation Structure
   - Using markdown for all documentation
   - Centralized memory bank approach
   - Version-controlled documentation

2. Development Workflow
   - Git flow branching strategy
   - Pull request reviews
   - Automated quality checks

3. Project Organization
   - Clear directory structure
   - Modular component design
   - Separation of concerns

## Current Blockers
- None at this stage

## Risks and Mitigations
1. Documentation Maintenance
   - Risk: Documentation becoming outdated
   - Mitigation: Regular review and update schedule

2. Workflow Adoption
   - Risk: Team resistance to new processes
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and gradual implementation

3. Technical Debt
   - Risk: Accumulation of technical debt
   - Mitigation: Regular code reviews and quality checks
